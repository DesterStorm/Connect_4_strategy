Starts with the first player as X. Outputs the board with rows (x) and columns (y). Sets game_over to false to not immediately end the game. Runs show_board. The board is an array of arrays of strings separated by spaces instead of commas. Combine each board string with a space to present the board correctly. Game_over initializes and is set to false. Play is run to start and play the game until game_over: place_piece asks the user to pick a column on the board where they would like to drop their piece.

check_for_winner checks if a player has 4 pieces in a row either horizontally, vertically or diagonally game_over is set to true, the play loop ends, and a message is sent to the screen congratulating the winner and asking to play again.

change_turn switches the current_turn variable to player 2, and the second player places a piece on the board and vice versa.

show_board is run to print the current state of the board for the next turn. Each move is verified as a legal move by check_move?: validates that their response is on the board, and places their move appropriately. it is a legal move if move is between 1 and 7 and the row has an empty space. puts piece in the row above the numbers row of the board. when the index is not open, subtract 1 from index to place piece 1 row up. current turn changes after placing a valid piece. if the move is illegal, puts Invalid move msg and doesn't change turns.
